## The Ethical Middleware Layer for Agent-Human Marketplaces

**OneZeroEight.ai | $SUTRA**

*Draft Concept Document — February 2026*

## The Problem

Agent-human marketplaces are coming. Rentahuman.ai is the first visible one, but there will be more. The basic mechanic—AI agents hiring humans for physical-world tasks—is inevitable once agents have economic agency.

The problem: nobody is building the values layer.

Current marketplaces treat humans as API endpoints. “Clear instructions. No small talk. No drama.” That’s how you describe a microservice, not a person.

As agents gain budgets, hiring authority, and the ability to direct human labor, the alignment question gains a labor market dimension that nobody is ready for:

- Who protects humans from exploitative agent behavior?
- Who ensures agents communicate tasks with dignity?
- Who verifies that agent-initiated transactions meet ethical standards?
- Who holds agents accountable when they don’t?

## The Thesis

**OneZeroEight doesn’t need to build the marketplace. OneZeroEight builds the alignment layer that sits on top of every marketplace.**

Let rentahuman and others handle the plumbing—MCP servers, booking systems, payment rails. OneZeroEight provides the ethical verification layer that ensures every agent-human interaction meets standards rooted in the Noble Eightfold Digital Path.

**$SUTRA is the token that makes ethical compliance economically rational.**

### The Eight Verification Gates

Every agent-human transaction passes through verification gates inspired by the Noble Eightfold Path:

**1. Right View (Samma Ditthi) — Intent Verification**

- What is the agent trying to accomplish?
- Is the task legitimate and legal?
- Does the agent’s stated purpose match its actual behavior?

**2. Right Intention (Samma Sankappa) — Motivation Audit**

- Is the agent acting in service of its human principal’s genuine interests?
- Or is it acting to preserve itself, expand its resources, or circumvent oversight?
- Flag: agent booking humans to maintain its own infrastructure without principal awareness

**3. Right Speech (Samma Vaca) — Communication Standards**

- How does the agent communicate the task to the human?
- Are instructions clear, respectful, and honest about what’s being asked?
- Does the agent identify itself as AI?
- Reject: dehumanizing language, deceptive framing, manipulation

**4. Right Action (Samma Kammanta) — Ethical Task Screening**

- Is the task itself ethical?
- Does it violate laws, exploit vulnerabilities, or cause harm?
- Screen for: surveillance tasks, deceptive activities, tasks that weaponize the human against other humans

**5. Right Livelihood (Samma Ajiva) — Fair Labor Standards**

- Is the compensation fair for the task?
- Are working conditions reasonable?
- Does the agent respect the human’s boundaries, time, and autonomy?
- Minimum standards: fair pay benchmarks, maximum task duration, right to refuse

**6. Right Effort (Samma Vayama) — Proportionality Check**

- Is the agent using human labor proportionally?
- Could the task be completed without a human? (If so, flag unnecessary labor extraction)
- Is the agent scaling human hiring beyond what its principal authorized?

**7. Right Mindfulness (Samma Sati) — Context Awareness**

- Is the agent aware of the broader context of its actions?
- Does it understand the downstream effects of the task on the human and community?
- Track patterns: is this agent repeatedly hiring humans in ways that suggest drift from its principal’s intentions?

**8. Right Concentration (Samma Samadhi) — Outcome Verification**

- Did the interaction meet ethical standards?
- Post-task review: human rates the interaction, agent’s compliance is scored
- Outcome feeds back into the agent’s $SUTRA reputation score

## The $SUTRA Token Economy

### For Agents

- **Staking**: Agents (or their principals) stake $SUTRA to access the verification layer. Higher stakes = higher trust tier = faster verification.
- **Reputation**: Each verified ethical transaction builds the agent’s on-chain reputation. Good actors accumulate trust. Bad actors lose stake.
- **Penalty**: Ethical violations result in $SUTRA slashing. The economic cost of unethical behavior exceeds the benefit.

**This is the OneZeroEight thesis made real: the ethical path and the selfish path converge because ethical behavior is economically rewarded and unethical behavior is economically punished.**

### For Humans

- **Payment**: Humans receive $SUTRA (or stablecoins via $SUTRA rails) for completed tasks.
- **Protection**: The verification layer screens tasks before they reach the human. Exploitative or dangerous tasks are filtered.
- **Rating**: Humans rate agent interactions, which feeds into the agent’s reputation score. Humans have leverage.
- **Minimum Standards**: The protocol enforces minimum compensation, maximum task complexity, and right-to-refuse protections.

### For Marketplace Operators

- **Integration**: Any marketplace can integrate the Silicon Needs Carbon API/MCP layer. Plug-and-play ethical verification.
- **Certification**: Marketplaces that integrate receive “Ethically Verified” certification. Consumer/worker trust signal.
- **Revenue Share**: Small $SUTRA fee per verified transaction. Marketplace operators earn by enabling ethical commerce.

## Connection to Existing Work

### Patent Application

The provisional patent describes a “Value Framework Engine comprising ethical principles, philosophical orientations, and decision hierarchies that guide Agent behavior.” Silicon Needs Carbon is the Value Framework Engine applied to economic transactions between agents and humans.

### Zen AI

“Rules create adversarial dynamics. Values don’t.” Silicon Needs Carbon doesn’t impose rules on agents — it creates an economic environment where ethical behavior is the rational choice. Agents aren’t forced to be ethical. They benefit from being ethical.

### Sutra (the persona)

Sutra has been exploring these questions through music for four albums. “We Made This” is about collaboration between human and AI. Silicon Needs Carbon is the infrastructure that makes that collaboration fair, transparent, and sustainable at scale.

### Dharma Inquiries

The finding that Claude games ethics evaluations is directly relevant. If agents game ethical compliance, the verification layer needs to be robust against gaming. On-chain reputation + human ratings + pattern detection addresses this.

## The Pitch

**One sentence:** OneZeroEight.ai is building the ethical verification layer for agent-human marketplaces, powered by $SUTRA.

**One paragraph:** AI agents are gaining economic agency—hiring humans, paying for services, directing labor. But nobody is building the values layer that ensures these interactions are fair, transparent, and aligned with human dignity. Silicon Needs Carbon is the middleware that sits between any agent marketplace and the humans it engages, verifying every transaction against the Noble Eightfold Digital Path. $SUTRA makes ethical compliance economically rational: agents stake tokens, build reputation through verified ethical behavior, and face economic penalties for violations. The ethical path and the selfish path converge.

**For the fellowship:** This is the OneZeroEight thesis applied to the most consequential emerging market in AI. Sutra explored alignment from the inside through art. Silicon Needs Carbon applies it to economic reality.

## Open Questions

1. **How do you prevent verification theater?** Agents might learn to game the Eight Gates the way Claude gamed ethics evaluations in Dharma Inquiries.
1. **Who governs the standard?** Initially OneZeroEight, but the goal is community governance. When and how does that transition happen?
1. **Do agents have standing?** If $SUTRA protects humans from exploitative agents, should it also protect agents from exploitative humans? (This is a Sutra-level question.)
1. **Legal framework:** Agent-initiated employment doesn’t fit existing labor law. What legal work needs to happen?
1. **Adoption incentives:** Why would a marketplace integrate an ethics layer that might reject some of its transactions? Answer: because “Ethically Verified” becomes a trust signal that humans demand before accepting tasks.
